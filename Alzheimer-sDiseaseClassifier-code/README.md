# Alzheimer Disease Classifier
As part of my work on detecting Alzheimer disease, I developed an image detection system to automatically identify abnormalities in brain scans that are indicative of the disease.

To build the system, I first collected a large dataset of brain scans, both from individuals with Alzheimer disease and from healthy controls. I then preprocessed the images to standardize their size and formatting.

Next, I used machine learning techniques to train a model on the preprocessed images. This involved feeding the model a large number of examples and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the true labels.

After training the model, I evaluated its performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and robustness. I also fine-tuned the model to further improve its performance, using techniques such as hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation.
